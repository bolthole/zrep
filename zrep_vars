# This should basically be included as common vars before all zrep stuff.
# It contains all 'constant' definitions, as well as a few crucial
# shared routines, such as lock handling ones.

# User tunable section. These may be overridden in user environment vars
SSH=${SSH:-ssh}
ZREP_PATH=${ZREP_PATH:-zrep}  #Set to /full/path/to/zrep, if needed, for remote

# Set this if you want to use a different zfs property to store zrep info.
# default has things like zrep:dest-host and zrep:dest-fs
# Change this to non-default, if you want to have multiple destinations.
# You then need to run a separate zrep for each dest. 
# In this case, I suggest all runs use non-default value.
#  eg:  ZREPTAG=zrep-1, ZREPTAG=zrep-2. 
#  or,  ZREPTAG=zrep-uk, ZREPTAG=zrep-us
#  ** make sure value can be used in a snapshot name as well, because it
#  ** will be !
#  !! also, make sure variable is EXPORTED !!
ZREPTAG=${ZREPTAG:-zrep}

#ZREP_CREATE_FLAGS="-o whatever"   #Use for extra options on remote zfs create

# If you'd like a little extra debug output define this env var to something
#DEBUG=1

# The fastest alternative transport, IF you have multicore/thread CPUs,
# would seem to be bbcp. If you have both, then you probably want to 
# define something like this in your environment:
#BBCP="bbcp -s 8"


# You can apply filters to tweak throughput in various ways
# Sometimes it helps receive performance to use mbuffer
# Other times, you may have highly compressible data, and custom
# compression routines such as lzop or lz4 may show significant
# gains over ssh builtin compression
#
# lz4 example:
# ZREP_OUTFILTER="lz4 -c"
# ZREP_INFILTER="lz4 -d"
#
# mbuffer example:
# ZREP_OUTFILTER="mbuffer -q -m 1G -s 128k"
# ZREP_INFILTER="mbuffer -q -m 1G -s 128k"



# If you want to recursively create/send snapshots, set this to -R
#  (or use the -R option to BOTH zrep init and zrep sync
#ZREP_R=-R

# The default incremental flag is -I. 
#   UNLESS you set ZREPTAG to something other than zrep, in which case
#   you will have multiple zrep snapshot names probably going to different
#   places, and expiration wont work properly on the remote sides
#   So we will autochange incremental type to -i. .. unless you explicitly 
#   set an override value for INC_FLAG in either case.
#ZREP_INC_FLAG=-I


# If you want to override uname -n, with an official
# canonical name for zrep:src-host, use this environment variable when you 
# run "zrep init"
#ZREP_SRC_HOST=somehost.your.dom

# Solaris hack, to use native perl, which isnt always in $PATH,but should
# always be there. It's also simple, straightforward, and non-extended.
# On other OSs this path will not exist, so it will just fall back to
# use the system default perl. Unless user wants to specify perl path.
# If you dont have /usr/perl5, this wont hurt you so just ignore it.
