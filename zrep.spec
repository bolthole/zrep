Summary:    a robust yet easy to use ZFS based replication and failover solution. It can also support a simple backup hub.
BuildArch:	noarch
%description
Zrep is an enterprise-grade, single-program solution for handling asynchronous,
continuous replication of a zfs filesystem, to another filesystem. That
filesystem can be on another machine, or on the same machine.

It also handles 'failover', as simply as "zrep failover datapool/yourfs".
It has many other related subcommands.

%prep
%setup -q -n %{name}-%{nversion}

# no build section is needed. zrep comes prebuilt. 
# however, if you change the source, you can run "make"
